# Whatsapp analysis

This python program analyses whatsapp group chats using jupyter notebook.

## How to use
- Download the .ipynb file and make sure you have installed jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/).
- Download the .txt log of your whatsapp group chat (https://faq.whatsapp.com/en/android/23756533/, download without media).
- Rename the chat log to chat.txt.
- Move to the directory where the .ipynb and .txt file are stored and enter 'jupyter notebook' in your terminal.
- The content of this directory will be displayed in your browser. Open the .ipynb file.
- Run the parts of code (especially the first bit, because it reads the .txt log at the top).

You're ready to go! 

## Some minor bugs
- It might not work if you're whatsapp language is english.
- The next word prediction is sometimes a bit off.

Both issues are probably not that hard to fix.

## Ideas
- Chatbot based on previous messages.
- Personal predictions. Current prediction uses all messages of everyone.
- Use unicode to predict emojis.
- Show activity over time.
- Include some fance graphs (matplotlib).

## Suggestions?
- Feel free to edit the code.
